<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/chbergma/">Christina Bergmann</a> and I have wanted to create a list of women and non-binary people in computational cognitive modelling for probably around 3-4 years now. It was tough when we first tried to do it: because it is not always clear who is a modeller just from looking at a scientific publication, as often being/self-identifying as a modeller is not exactly the same as being on the author list of a modelling paper; because Twitter lists, which were our first idea, sadly live and die by the single person who created them on Twitter; and because at the time neither her nor I really knew how to reach out to get such lists from others, broadening our horizons.

[Edit: <b>Now a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HWcovuA4JWY6nZb6gEF2f-dbLR1__-99qjbg9Y0g3CY/edit?usp=sharing">Google Spreadsheet</a> exists — add yourselves!</b>]

The other day — thanks to <a href="https://sites.temple.edu/newcombe/">Nora Newcombe</a> for making me think of this by asking about a related topic — I decided my Twitter account was probably a good place to ask the scientific community for the names of women and non-binary people in cognitive modelling. To my pleasant surprise, the tweet (below and <a href = "https://twitter.com/o_guest/status/987013239618883585?tfw_creator=o_guest%20&tfw_site=o_guest%20&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A4000%2Fwomen-nb-cog-modellers">here</a>) managed to generate a larger amount of names in the replies than I alone could ever:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey, science tweeps! 🧠<br><br>I want names of women &amp; non-binary cognitive modellers.<br><br>👨🏿‍💻👩🏻‍💻👩🏼‍💻👨🏽‍💻👩🏾‍💻👩🏿‍💻👨🏼‍💻👩🏽‍💻👨🏾‍💻<br><br>Tag them here or if they aren&#39;t on twitter post a link to academic websites. Pls RT so we&#39;ve a good chance of finding many! ☺️</p>&mdash; Olivia Guest (@o_guest) <a href="https://twitter.com/o_guest/status/987013239618883585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 19, 2018</a></blockquote>

A couple of people have asked, but sadly I am loathe to create a more formal list based on this tweet because the majority of these names have been volunteered instead of the modellers coming forward themselves, explicitly consenting to being added. Google and search engines generally love a website (outside Twitter and Google Sheets) with a list of names and links but have significantly less love for a Twitter thread. So thankfully if you have been volunteered on that Twitter thread and you would rather not have been (for whatever reason) it is very unlikely search engines will notice. However, I would still like to keep an easier to find link (this page) to this tweet and the spreadsheet in case anybody else finds this as useful as I do. 

Hopefully, a website (dedicated to the list and joining it based off the spreadsheet) will be forthcoming — but I sadly cannot promise anything. Until then, please use the <a href="https://twitter.com/o_guest/status/987013239618883585">tweet</a> (way more names at the present, so if you are looking for names, go there) and the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HWcovuA4JWY6nZb6gEF2f-dbLR1__-99qjbg9Y0g3CY/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a> (if you want to add names, go there).

Finally, thank you everybody for all the names and support!
