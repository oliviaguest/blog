<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/chbergma/">Christina Bergmann</a> and I have wanted to create a list of women and non-binary people in computational cognitive modelling for probably around 3-4 years now (she has written more on this on CogTales, <a href="https://cogtales.wordpress.com/2018/04/25/building-a-network-of-women-and-nonbinary-cognitive-modelers/"><i>Building a network of women and nonbinary cognitive modelers</i></a>). It was tough when we first tried to do it: because it is not always clear who is a modeller just from looking at a scientific publication, as often being/self-identifying as a modeller is not exactly the same as being on the author list of a modelling paper; because Twitter lists, which were our first idea, sadly live and die by the single person who created them on Twitter; and because at the time neither her nor I really knew how to reach out to get such lists from others, broadening our horizons.

The other day — thanks to <a href="https://sites.temple.edu/newcombe/">Nora Newcombe</a> for making me think of this by asking about a related topic — I decided my Twitter account was probably a good place to ask the scientific community for the names of women and non-binary people in cognitive modelling. To my pleasant surprise, the tweet (below and <a href = "https://twitter.com/o_guest/status/987013239618883585?tfw_creator=o_guest%20&tfw_site=o_guest%20&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A4000%2Fwomen-nb-cog-modellers">here</a>) managed to generate a larger amount of names in the replies than I alone could ever:
